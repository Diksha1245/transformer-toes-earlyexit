# Token-Adaptive Early Exit Configuration and Results Log
# Updated: 2025-08-06

## Current Parameters (Baseline)
vocab_size = 1000
hidden_size = 256
num_layers = 6
num_decoder_layers = 6
num_heads = 8
max_candidates = 50
early_exit_threshold = 0.5
learning_rate = 2e-5
batch_size = 8
num_epochs = 2
sequence_length = 128

## Performance Metrics (Last Run)
GPT_ToEx_Loss = 6.9199
GPT_Baseline_Loss = 7.0911
Transformer_ToEx_Loss = 6.9176
Transformer_Baseline_Loss = 7.0859
Early_Exit_Rate = 0.0%
Computational_Savings = 0.0%

## Issues Identified
1. Early exit threshold too high (0.5) - no exits triggered
2. Need accuracy metric instead of just loss
3. Missing exit speed analysis
4. No token-level exit tracking
5. Need more aggressive threshold tuning

## Optimization Targets
1. Reduce loss by 10-15%
2. Achieve 20-40% early exit rate
3. Maintain or improve accuracy
4. Track exit latency and token patterns
5. Implement dynamic threshold adjustment

## Next Optimizations
- Lower early_exit_threshold from 0.5 to 0.2-0.3
- Add accuracy calculation
- Implement per-token exit tracking
- Add exit speed measurements
- Include confidence distribution analysis
